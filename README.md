# ENSE-405-Project
University of Regina Software Systems Engineering class(ENSE 405) Project: Designing Apps for Learning &amp; Collaboration.


## Project idea/background & business need/opportunity
Why don’t we have some way to find the best tutorials and DIYs on YouTube? 

There are too many videos on YouTube. When someone searches for what they want to watch to learn, they could be overwhelmed by the large volume of results. Our idea starts here. What if a community of members could rank, review, or recommend of a tutorial video on YouTube, like the retweet functionality on the Twitter app. 

This application could help someone who is seeking a higher quality education resource on YouTube.

## Reason
On YouTube, there are a bunch of tutorials about many different subjects. This might be frustrating to someone searching a video clip for a specific subject. Our project aims:

* To narrow down the results, community members or someone who has already watched the tutorial can help others find what they are looking for.
* To build a community to share educational resources and offer supplementary comments regarding those videos.

## Impact
The impact of this application is providing an accessible way to share educational resources across the globe. Additionally, our application would cultivate a community of learners to share their knowledge and potentially improve upon the shared educational resources.

## Who
*	Audience: Anyone who seeks a useful tutorial video clip.
*	Someone who already watched the tutorial could give feedback for others. So, someone’s voluntary feedback only could make it valuable.
*	YouTube is open to anyone who uses Internet. However, it takes time and effort to find some valuable resources. We would like to connect good feedback with seekers of educational opportunities.

## What
The one of constraints for this application is the motivation for the community to provide feedback.

In addition to that, when it comes to deployment of the application, there exists another obstacle, such as getting domain name, web hosting and database hosting, etc. Because they require financial support as well. 

Another constrains are deciding which stacks will be used for implementing the application, like deciding between native JavaScript and frameworks, or between Relational database or No SQL database, etc. 

The constraints obviously need to be having rationale reasonings for deciding which stacks or financial support would be for the project.
